*   **Variety of Projects:** A good course should offer a diverse range of projects to help you master different techniques and materials.
*   **Expert Instruction:** Ideally, the instructor should be an experienced Cricut user with a proven track record of creating successful projects. Look for instructors who can explain complex concepts in an easy-to-understand way.
*   **Community Support:** A supportive community can be invaluable for learning and troubleshooting. Look for lessons that include access to a forum or group where you can connect with other Cricut users.
