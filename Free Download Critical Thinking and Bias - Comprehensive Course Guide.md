## Core Concepts Covered in the Course

To truly grasp the power of critical thinking and bias awareness, it's important to understand some key concepts:

*   **Logic:** The science of reasoning. Understanding basic logical principles and fallacies is crucial for evaluating arguments and making sound judgments.

    *   **Appeal to Authority:** Citing an authority figure as evidence, even if they are not an expert on the topic.
    *   **False Dilemma:** Presenting only two options as if they are the only possibilities.
*   **Cognitive Biases:** Systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. These biases are often unconscious and can significantly affect our decisions.
*   **Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms our existing beliefs.
