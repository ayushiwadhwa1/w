## Avoiding Common Mistakes

Even with the best intentions, it's easy to make mistakes when decorating for events. Here are a few common pitfalls to avoid:

*   **Overcrowding:** Don't overdo the d√©cor. Too many decorations can make a space feel cluttered and overwhelming.
*   **Clashing Colors:** Avoid using colors that clash or compete with each other. Stick to a cohesive color palette that complements the event's theme.
*   **Ignoring the Venue:** The venue is an important factor in event d√©cor. Consider the venue's style, size, and existing d√©cor when planning your decorations.
*   **Neglecting Lighting:** Lighting is often overlooked, but it can dramatically transform a space. Use lighting to create depth, highlight focal points, and set the desired atmosphere.
*   **Forgetting Functionality:** Decorations should be both beautiful and functional. Make sure decorations don't obstruct walkways or interfere with guests' enjoyment of the event.
