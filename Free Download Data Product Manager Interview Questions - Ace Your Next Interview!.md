## Why Focus on Data Product Manager Interview Questions?

Preparing for any interview is essential, but the Data Product Manager interview requires a unique approach. Unlike traditional product management, data product management requires a strong understanding of data science, machine learning, and data engineering. Recruiters want to see that you can bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders, translating complex data insights into actionable product features and strategies.
