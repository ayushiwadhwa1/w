## What is Dropshipping and Why is it Popular?

Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where you, as a store owner, don't keep the products you sell in stock. Instead, when a customer buys something from your store, you purchase the item from a third-party supplier, who then ships it directly to the customer. This eliminates the need for you to manage inventory, allowing you to focus on marketing and customer service.

Here's why dropshipping has become so popular:

*   **Low Startup Costs:** No need to invest heavily in inventory.
*   **Wide Product Selection:** Offer a vast range of products without the risk of holding them.
*   **Location Independence:** Run your business from anywhere with an internet connection.
*   **Scalability:** Easily scale your business as demand grows without worrying about storage and fulfillment.
*   **Flexibility:** Test new products and markets without significant financial risk.

## Key Concepts Covered in a "Curso de Dropshipping"
