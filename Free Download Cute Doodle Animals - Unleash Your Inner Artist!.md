## Mastering the Basics of Animal Doodles

Before you start drawing complex animal doodles, it's essential to master the basics. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1.  **Start with Simple Shapes:** Most animal doodles can be broken down into basic shapes like circles, ovals, triangles, and squares. Begin by sketching these shapes lightly on your paper.
2.  **Add the Main Features:** Once you have the basic shapes, add the animal's main features, such as its head, body, legs, and tail. Keep these features simple and proportionate.
3.  **Refine the Details:** After you've outlined the main features, start refining the details. Add eyes, ears, noses, and mouths. Pay attention to the animal's unique characteristics and try to capture its personality.
4.  **Add Embellishments:** Once you're happy with the basic outline, add embellishments like patterns, textures, and accessories. This is where you can really let your creativity shine.
5.  **Practice Regularly:** The key to mastering animal doodles is practice. The more you doodle, the better you'll become at capturing the essence of each animal.
