Let's dive into a detailed comparison of Coursera and edX across several important categories:

The range is incredibly diverse, covering subjects from computer science and data science to humanities and business. Coursera partners extensively with industry leaders like Google and IBM to offer professional certificate programs.
*   **edX:** Similarly offers a wide range of courses, MicroMasters programs, and degrees, primarily focusing on subjects like computer science, engineering, and business. edX is founded by Harvard and MIT, and it maintains strong ties with top research institutions. The content tends to be more academic in nature compared to Coursera.

Specializations and degrees require paid subscriptions. Coursera also provides financial aid to eligible learners, covering a portion or the full cost of a Specialization or degree.
*   **edX:** Similar to Coursera, edX offers both free and paid courses. The "audit" option allows you to access course materials without earning a certificate.
